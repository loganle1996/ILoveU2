# I Love You -  SADI Project Repository

## Notice
- Vlad has specified to follow design patterns - when proceeding to code, try to follow design patterns as much as possible.

## To Do
* Add more design patterns to the project ( *7 at least?* )
* Create scrolls - details to be discussed - Fireball and Ice Wall
* Optimize game performance - Demo is **VERY** shaky
